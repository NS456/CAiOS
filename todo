ipad simulator reports window create before app finished loading; this is prob the bug which I "fixed' with inputHack. Move setting up of keyboards for ipad from appDelegate to viewdidload; but check what is done for iPhone, which must be different??

there is a constraint bug - in select  menu occurs in simulator for iphone 8+
UIView:0x7fdaab716c40.width == - 16 -- but not in my xib??

new version should

--- keyboard input now seems to work for pattern and anagram
       sel pt wrong for insertion on numLetters, , (allow , before but not after a comma
       clean textChanged = possibly not needed at all for pattern and anag except for OKtoSearch
       unlocked mode, enter char does not set the numLetters Field (cooment out from textChanged
       
       clear unlocked - does not empty all results and numResults fields???? (or does same search ! currentPattern not set!!!!!
              which is now done in trim (modify, so bypassed
             and is not searching on entry of chars !
       fixed: (?)
       --lengthlock flag should set fixed pattern flag but leave sel pt fixed - not working (sel needs resettin I think
       --trim is wrong for unlocked mode - should only change if exceeds length
       
---- currently trying to get alphapadButton to do the parsing - ALL DONE???
   insertion if comma is odd 3,3 allows ZZZ,ZZ, (and crash if add or delete more chars)
   trimstring needs to have commas in correct places
   crashes still?? 1. forward delete from last posn then backdelete - prob range error 
   backspace needs to have trim string add - at end, 
        and not delete comma (why doesnt current test for character at s0 not work?? (prob fixed, s0-1; forward delete works)  
   clear button still needs to be made to work in lengthlock mode - ---- but with sel at 0 (modify to conform???
      --- there is a method in UITextInput or some such.. [self textFieldShouldClear:patternField] (BOOL)
      
      modifytoconform - I think needs pattenField needs to be FirstResponder to set sel.
      hmm still not enough. But Clear works to set sel (sometimes!!)
            Maybe only works if editing that field; or at least mot editing some other field???

modifypatterntoconform (or somewhere) 
    clear pattern should set selection to start
in alphapad with patternfield:
    ignore , unless in posn
    if alpha and in , posn, add it after , and advance selection
    backdelete - dont delete comma in prop posn (just backspace); set selection poroperly

foll done I think 

1. put in  version file so we can tell what we are updating; and Settings Bundle (done) done

2. install the users add/delete words to the new dictionaries! -only in launch??;\- and maybe alert
with "apply these changes to just installed dictionary?" 
     if user later downloads a library dictionary we could also alert that user has previously made changes to this dictionary

3. report the users mod file back to our site if users allows - and set in the SettingsBundle

4. in unlocked mode the number of letters should be set to current length if cleared - not a bug but clarified with message

after install new dictionary or delete, if in Show Dictionaries update - done

nb delete the userAdditions and UserDeletions files from bundle ??? where???

we need notification for new dictionaries
NB check that correct date for existing UserAdditions is created in userChanges - currently seems to be 1 Jan 2001
alertPhone needs fixing - antialiasing, smaller size (nb bg is 255,255,230)
needs position set on rotation
also action to open Changes
-show on launch if update available-when to hide -only when installed??

delete multiple items -- fix parsing of OLD userDeletions - if a deletion started a 
subsequent line not starting with digit or space is a continuation
 ---- change setupuserchnges in way it parses userDeletions
 ---- changes: can now format this better (strip foll \n,insert spaces.. or perhaps create Change dict here
 ---- consequent fixes to writeUserChanges and addUserChangesTo array
 
   
bug in locked mode can insert , in any place, not corrected by parser

---------


bug 9,C,VG then clear pattern (and or anagram) does not research (or leaves patter unchanged?

-- clear pattern while editing anagram or vv

new black interface for iPad - check colors



Localisation


icon

CAEncoder!!! needs to be found and recompiled!!!!

--user dictionaries: unpack, install DONE
but: changing name of bad CAdict doesn't seem to work  - does work?


------ Done??

download -file  - Done??
Tests needed: prev version (downloaded or user installed - different!), install over current, bad files

fix pattern and anagram conforming - empty if all -- 

!lengthLockFlag not working!!!!


re-install deleted userdict 

--- main bug fixed but reinstall bundled dict does not set the the dict ?? check return err - was wrong now OK
--- reinstall user crashes on close(filePtr) ??? why not catch error??? 
 
    --- thinks Italiano is installed (come from b/g and in the installed list), but does not list in the dictPicker???
    1. remove userDct then try to reinsta
        we get "may be corrupted"!!! and thereafter on return from b/g, it think it is installed in 2 places, but does not list???
        sounds like sourcePath is not correct for a userDict (at least when userDeleted


(set dict from dictPicker should do doSearch - doesnt seem to always?? In partic when reinstalled!!! (also firsttime)
try doSearch in setDictionary?
 --- came up with curr dict set to a removed dict - but attempt to install it crashed???
  --- again possibly recompiled a removed??




check that updating dictionary to a later version updates theDictionaries correctly (sourcepath etc)
fully test useradded dicts, removal etc
